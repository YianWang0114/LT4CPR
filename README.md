# LT4CPR - Low-Resource Language Generation using Large Language Models

## Overview

The goal of the LT4CPR project (Version 2) is to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sentences for low-resource languages. This project involves multiple stages of data generation, verification, and analysis to ensure the quality and reliability of the generated sentences.

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Generation**: Raw language data is generated by chatgpt for various low-resource languages. You can find the data for each language in the following directory: v2/chatgpt/region3/X/raw (replace "X" with the language name).

2. **Verification**: The quality of the generated sentences is verified through a two-step process:
   - First, we check for repeated sentences within the generated data. Repeated sentences can be found here: v2/chatgpt/region3/X/repeated.
   - Second, we send the sentences generated by one LLM to another LLM for language recognition. The verification results for each language are available here: v2/chatgpt/region3/X/verification.

3. **Analysis**: In-depth analysis of the verification results and other relevant data can be found in the project's analysis documents. You can access the analysis for Region 3 here: [Region3 Analysis](https://github.com/YianWang0114/LT4CPR/tree/main/v2/chatgpt/region3/X/result.txt).
